# In progress

# Ball-Game
STM32F429I-DISCO1, gyroscope and lcd

# Current functionality
- Initialaized embedded LCD and Gyroscope
- Drawing simple objects with BSP library (ball, rectangle)
- Gyroscope sends data via SPI5, need to configure embedded high-pass filter
- Attempt to use different Layers on Display (much smoother refreshing)

# To do
- Implement high-pass filter in program
- Game rules
- Collisions

# Libraries
- BSP
- Utilities
